The dataset comprises over 30,000 images, which are preprocessed using TensorFlow and Keras with data augmentation to enhance model performance. The CNN architecture includes several convolutional and max pooling layers, followed by dense layers for binary classification, and is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function. The model is trained for three epochs, achieving high accuracy rates, and features a user-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter that allows users to upload images for real-time prediction. This project not only demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in environmental monitoring but also emphasizes the role of technology in disasterÂ management.
